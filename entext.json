    "statementTitle": "Artist Statement",
    "statementText": "I create sculptures in which modern production technologies meet the legacy of past engineering thought. My art is a search for form, structure, and material that reflect the logic of scientific progress. In my works, I combine 3D printing, laser cutting, and digital processing, striving to show a dialogue between the past and the future."
