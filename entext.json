    "bioText": "Mark Bogdanov is an artist working at the intersection of art, technology, and engineering aesthetics. In his works, he explores the influence of scientific progress on visual forms, combining modern production methods (3D printing, laser cutting, digital processing) with traditional materials.\n\nHe was born in 1998 into a family of choreographers and grew up between St. Petersburg and Odessa — two cities with deep cultural traditions. His childhood and youth coincided with the pivotal decades of the digital revolution, when art and technology began to converge rapidly. This period shaped his interest in new methods of creating and perceiving art, where the material object increasingly merged with virtual and mechanical components.\n\nHaving received an education in opto-electronics, he reinterpreted the principles of traditional sculpture through the lens of scientific knowledge. Inspired by constructivism, retrofuturism, and engineering thinking, he views art not only as a means of self-expression but also as a way to explore the structure of the surrounding world. His works investigate how technologies not only transform artistic aesthetics but also establish new principles of interaction between humans and objects.",

    "statementText": "I create sculptures in which modern production technologies meet the heritage of past engineering thought. My art is a quest for form, structure, and material that reflects the logic of scientific progress.\n\nIn my works, I combine 3D printing, laser cutting, digital processing, and traditional craft techniques, integrating them into a unified artistic system. It is important for me to show how technologies shape aesthetics and how they can be used to create new visual meanings that transcend conventional perception.\n\nI am inspired by constructivism, retrofuturism, and engineering thinking, viewing art as a means of interacting with scientific knowledge. In my sculptures, one can see the intertextuality of engineering solutions, where every detail carries meaning and alludes to mechanics, architecture, and optics.\n\nI am interested in the dialogue between the past and the future: how technologies change while principles remain eternal. In this, I see beauty — in the intertwining of precision, form, and concept."
